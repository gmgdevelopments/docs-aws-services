The [Service Broker for AWS](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-service-broker-for-aws) provides [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) users with the ability to create and manage Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources from the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

The PCF Service Broker for AWS is installed once and exposes the selected AWS services in the Marketplace. App developers can then create and manage a service instance by using the cf CLI commands `create service`, `bind service`, `unbind service`, and `delete service`. After obtaining a service key using the `create-service-key` command, developers can use the key with the AWS CLI to perform additional operations as permitted by their PCF operator.

* [AWS RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
